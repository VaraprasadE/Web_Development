            <h2>What is DIGITAL FORENSICS</h2>
        
            Digital Forensics is defined as the process of preservation, identification, extraction, and documentation of computer evidence which can be used by the court of law. It is a science of finding evidence from digital media like a computer, mobile phone, server, or network. It provides the forensic team with the best techniques and tools to solve complicated digital-related cases.

                HISTORY OF DIGITAL FORENSICS</h3>
        
               <P> History of Digital forensics
                Here, are important landmarks from the history of Digital Forensics:
                
                Hans Gross (1847 -1915): First use of scientific study to head criminal investigations
                FBI (1932): Set up a lab to offer forensics services to all field agents and other law authorities across the USA.
                In 1978 the first computer crime was recognized in the Florida Computer Crime Act.
                Francis Galton (1982 – 1911): Conducted first recorded study of fingerprints
                In 1992, the term Computer Forensics was used in academic literature.
                1995 International Organization on Computer Evidence (IOCE) was formed.
                In 2000, the First FBI Regional Computer Forensic Laboratory established.
                In 2002, Scientific Working Group on Digital Evidence (SWGDE) published the first book about digital forensic called “Best practices for Computer Forensics”.
                In 2010, Simson Garfinkel identified issues facing digital investigations.</P>
